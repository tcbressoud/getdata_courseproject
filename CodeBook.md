===============================================
----------
The document describes the tidy data set generated by the <tt>run_analysis.R</tt> script per the instructions of the course project in the Johns Hopkins/Coursera course, *Getting and Cleaning Data*.

The key of the resultant data frame is unique for each pair of a subject and an activity.  The remaining columns in the dataframe are the average obtained by aggregating each variable over the set of observations from the original dataset for a subject/activity pair.  The result has 180 rows, and there are 79 columns corresponding to mean and standard deviation variables from the original dataset, giving a total of 81 columns when we include subject and activity.

The columns are described following:

 - subject: an integer in the range 1 to 30 identifying the particular subject in the HAR experiment
 - activity: a lower case character string from the set of six strings -- 'laying', 'sitting', 'standing', 'walking', 'walking\_downstairs', and 'walking\_upstairs'

The following variable categories can be partitioned into 3-axial categories and magnitude categories.  For each of the 3-axial categories, there are three variables that correspond to the mean of the x, y, and z dimension for the category, and three variables that correspond to the standard deviation of the x, y, and z.  As described above, all of these variables are obtained by taking the average of each variable from the original dataset across each subject and activity pair.

Actual variable names for 3-axial categories are obtained by taking each of the categories enumerated below and adding one of the six suffixes:

 - <tt>_mean_x</tt>
 -  <tt>_mean_y</tt>
 -  <tt>_mean_z</tt>
 -  <tt>_std_x</tt>
 -  <tt>_std_y</tt>
 -  <tt>_std_z</tt>

The 3-axial categories:
- timebodyaccel
- timegravityaccel
- timebodyacceljerk
- timebodygyro
- timebodygyrojerk
- freqbodyaccel
- freqbodyacceljerk
- freqbodygyro
- freqbodygyrojerk

For each of the magnitude categories, obtained by taking the Euclidian norm of their x/y/z counterpart, variables for the mean and standard deviation are present in the resultant dataset, and are obtained by adding the suffix <tt>\_mean</tt> and <tt>\_std</tt> to each of the following categories:
 
- timebodyaccelmag
- timegravityaccelmag
- timebodyacceljerkmag
- timebodygyromag
- timebodygyrojerkmag
- freqbodyaccelmag
- freqbodyacceljerkmag
- freqbodygyromag
- freqbodygyrojerkmag
